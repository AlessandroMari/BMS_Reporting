### Short instructions for producing the report

#### Installation:

- Install the latest version of [Rstudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Install the latest version of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) for Mac (MacTeX) or for Windows (MiKTeX).

#### To know:

- Use this folder ("BMS Report" folder) as the main folder for the work.
- In the "background" folder the image for the frontpage (first page) of the report can be found. If you want to change 
  it be sure that the new one has the same format and name.
- The "graphs" folder must contain the graphs produced inside the "BMS Data" folder and used by the report script.
  Therefore, just copy the graphs folder from the "BMS Data" folder into the "BMS Report" folder.
  If you updated the graphs in the "BMS Data" folder: simply copy and substitute the "graphs" folder inside the "BMS Report"
  folder. 
- The "images" folder contains all the images that are not graphs. For example, species images should be placed in here.
- The "latex_templates" folder contains the latex file that is used to edit the report layout, but also for other things like
  logos positioning in the front page. This folder should not be opened unless it is necessary to edit the latex file
- The "logos" folder contains logos images.

#### For the report creation:

- For accessing the Rmarkdown script, open the project "Report_BMS.Rproj". In this way you will enter directly
  in the right environment ("BMS Report" folder). Then, open Rmarkdown document "Report.Rmd" from the "files" section in the lower-right part of Rstudio window. 	
- The document template is provided with text and the consequent figure positioning relative to the ITBMS report for the year 2020. Therefore text is only illustrative and the   user is ought to edit it according to the results achieved for its own BMS.
