BMS datasets and variables requirement to be analyzed with the different scripts. 
Names of both datasets and variables has to be respected.
Dataset has to be in the "datatable" format (package: "data.table", function to import: fread() or function to convert: as.data.table()). 
Anyway, their format is also checked by the main script and a conversion is performed if they are not in the right format. 

Between [] an example of the variable value is provided.
[]* variable not used (and not required ideally), but informative for an eventual exploration of the BMS data
